  # User's guide

Withsystem AI Labeling Tool (WALT) is a web-based tool which helps to annotate videos and images for Computer Vision algorithms and 
to develo AI model and service prototype. WALT has many powerful features: _interpolation of bounding boxes between key frames, 
automatic annotation using deep learning models,shortcuts for most of critical actions, dashboard with a list of annotation tasks, etc...

### Creating an annotation task

1.  Create an annotation task pressing `Create new task` button on the main page.
